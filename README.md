# Eraser

Delete highlights by holding the Eraser button and swiping over them.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `eraser.koplugin` to your KOReader plugins directory:
   - Kobo: `/mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/`
   - Other: `<koreader>/plugins/`

2. Restart KOReader

3. Hold Eraser button + swipe over highlights to delete them

That's it! No confirmations, just instant deletion.

## Requirements

**Currently Kobo-only**: The "Eraser" button event is only mapped in KOReader's Kobo device driver (`frontend/device/kobo/device.lua:835`). Other e-reader platforms haven't implemented this button mapping yet.

**Tested on**: Kobo Libra 2 Colour

**Should work on**: Any Kobo device with a hardware Eraser button (Elipsa, Sage, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Open a document with highlights
2. Press and hold the **Eraser button** on your device
3. Swipe your finger or stylus over highlights
4. Highlights disappear instantly
5. Release the button when done

Normal highlighting (tap, long-press) still works when Eraser isn't held.

## Troubleshooting

**Eraser button doesn't work**
- Make sure you have a Kobo device with an Eraser button
- Restart KOReader after installation
- Check that you're holding the button while swiping

**Highlights not deleted**
- Ensure highlights are visible on the current page
- Try both quick swipe and long-press drag gestures
- Verify the Eraser button is mapped (Kobo devices only)

**For other e-reader brands**
This plugin currently only works on Kobo devices. To add support for other devices, the "Eraser" key event needs to be mapped in that device's driver file (similar to `frontend/device/kobo/device.lua:835`).

**Note**: This plugin works by intercepting touch events when the Eraser button is held. It doesn't affect normal reading or highlighting when the button isn't pressed.
